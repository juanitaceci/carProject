Q: What is stashing?
A: Saving your codes to a temp area for later use.

Q: Why do we need stashing?
A: 1. You are working on a new test feature that you do not want
   yet to be commits because you are not sure whether it will be working or not
   2. In order to update your local repo in sync with the remote repo, without
   discarding the changes in working directory.
